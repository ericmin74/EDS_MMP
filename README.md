# EDS_MMP
Full code and data repository for "Label-free differentiation of classical and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndromes using Mueller matrix polarimetry" (2025) by Tumanova et al. This is for submission to Biophotonics Discovery. 

Folders:
- Analysis code (.ipynb files): Contains code used to compute Stokes vectors, Mueller matrices and MMP parameters for images corresponding to each sample (i.e. PXX, where XX is the sample number). Contains three sub folders corresponding to healthy, cEDS and hEDS samples. 
- Co-registration code (MATLAB files): Contains code and another README.txt file used to co-register raw images to correct artefacts caused by off-axis rays.
