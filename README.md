# EDS_MMP
Full code and data repository for "Label-free differentiation of classical and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndromes using Mueller matrix polarimetry" (2025) by Tumanova et al. This is for submission to Biophotonics Discovery. 

Description of files/folders:
- P12.ipynb: MMP analysis code and additional image processing for representative healthy skin biopsy sample used in Figures 2-3. Code was written by Kseniia Tumanova and Eric Min. 
- P15.ipynb: MMP analysis code and additional image processing for representative cEDS skin biopsy sample used in Figures 2-4. Code was written by Kseniia Tumanova and Eric Min. 
- P10.ipynb: MMP analysis code and additional image processing for representative hEDS skin biopsy sample used in Figures 2-4. Code was written by Kseniia Tumanova and Eric Min.
  
Note that all analysis code for the above three samples are approximately equivalent for other samples. The only differences were the cropping dimensions. As Github does not accommodate large files, these files have been omitted to save space. If more information is required, do contact the author at k.tumanova@mail.utoronto.ca. 
  
- MM_full_stats_forsubmission.xlsx: Mean, median, standard deviation, skew and kurtosis values for all tested parameters, for all samples, computed in Python using analysis methods in the above three files.
- registration_daniel: Contains relevant code and another README.txt file for co-registeration of raw images to correct artefacts caused by off-axis rays. Code was written by Daniel C. Louie.
